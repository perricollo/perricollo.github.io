# Dwarves
### \- Appearance
About 2-4 cm in length. Orange scaly skin with black spots on the back, plain grey on the underside. Look similar to geckos, see server icon. 
### \- Body function details
Sticky hands and feet. Coldblooded, so they get sluggish when temperature drops, unless heating is provided. At their size using clothes for thermal insulation is futile. Can fall from high places without much damage. Swim quite well, if the water isn't too cold.
### \- Reproduction
Dwarves are closest to hermaphrodites, though their method of reproduction is not exactly regular. Two dwarves come together and start building a cocoon around themselves out of plant fiber mixed with saliva. Once they are encased, their bodies melt and mix together in a strange metamorphosis and then grow into 2 to 4 new dwarves depending on how well fed the parents were. 
The offspring retain parts of the originals' memories but precise information might get mixed up or lost. This means most of the time younglings still require memory refreshing, and that not too many can engage in reproduction if they want to avoid losing memories.
### \- Minds and Telepathy
A lone dwarf can't do much. Able to finish simple tasks and has limited memory. About 20 are needed together for basic human intelligence, though the memory won't be able to hold that much information. 50 are the gold standard for barebones self-sufficiency and good stability though they still tend to work together with other groups. More than 70 becomes unstable and has a tendency to split apart.
Telepathy is natural and instinctive. If dwarves that are otherwise unaffiliated come close together, a connection will spontaneously form between them. Once they reach somewhere between 10 and 20 members, a common awareness emerges from the connection, creating a hivemind. This hivemind will instinctively try to assimilate any living thing that comes in between its members.
# Tribes
The closest thing to an individual in this age. A telepathically linked group of 20-50 dwarves. They have to stay relatively close together to stay connected (1-2 meters at max). A temporary split to fulfill separate tasks is possible but keep in mind that the split off parts might be limited in intellect and that they won't be able to freely share thoughts anymore.
### \- Personality
Dwarves tend to be creatures of habit and adherence to protocol (more on protocol in the **clans** section). Longwinded discussions on the *right* way to do things are commonplace, even if there's no practical difference. (imagine the milk or cereal first schism)
### \- Relationships
In this age it's mostly quite simple. Singular tribes can sometimes come together and combine parts of their population either to form a new one or to revitalize their gene pool, often from different clans to keep diversity. (this is sex basically)
They can form more permanent relationships based on mutual support and/or population mixing, which are closer than the clan bond and involve 2 or 3 tribes, rarely more. They can be referred to as "joined" tribes, or just partners. It is customary that the younger tribe becomes part of the elder's clan, if the relationship is to be long term.
### \- Pronouns
Dwarf tribes are genderless, so it only makes sense they use gender neutral pronouns. They, It, Xey, etc. Some tribes don't use pronouns at all and instead refer to each other by initials. Some tribes don't even use first or second person. The world is your oyster.
# Clans
Clans are the basic societal unit, a sort of family. 5 to 10 tribes working together, most often closely related. Multiple clans can form even bigger structures in particularly fertile places. 
### \- Customs
Most clans have a set of customs they follow: a common naming scheme, how they refer to each other, phrases, how they decide on things (does the elder have final say? are they democratic?), ways of greeting each other, how courting and romance works, the possibilities are endless. 
Other than that there may be rituals. Do they pray to the gods before going to hunt? Do they do sacrifices? Any initiation ceremonies for new members?
### \- Roles
Very often each tribe in a clan specializes in a certain role: elder/leader, story keeper, forager, woodworker, beetle herder, fungi farmer... Depending on the role they might have a different social position in the clan or act differently.
### \- Beliefs
Many clans will have a set of animist or sometimes polytheistic beliefs about how the world works. Much like in humanity's early history, the patron deities/spirits of a single clan are not the Only True Ones but simply one of many, this makes them surprisingly tolerant about religion.
# Other species
### \- Beetles
Dwarves can herd them or have them as livestock. Basically Earth insects. Some insects hunt dwarves but are most often possible to drive off with simple weapons (hornets especially).
### \- Fungi, lichen, plants
A lot of clans have symbiotic fungi or lichen that they let grow on dead biomass and then eat, carrying its spores in return. Plants are chill. Pretty sparse on the mountains, with regular forests in the lowlands. The trees are gigantic compared to dwarves.
### \- Flesh Beasts
Mostly normal animals to us, though there are some that are especially dangerous to the dwarves. This makes it quite impossible for large populations to survive in more fertile places. Imagine armadillo-anteaters, birds, etc. These animals are generally too large or too armored to defeat and must be escaped from. 
More inventive clans have started constructing simple siege weaponry or rockfall traps, but with the current population scale and technology level it's only enough to deter smaller or younger beasts.
# Geography
## \- Regions
### -- the Mountains
You will be starting in the Mountains (which will later be known as the Ancestral Range but right now it's the only mountain range the dwarves know so they name it this way). They run from north to south. On their west are Deadly Woods populated by flesh beasts and on their east is a wide nearly-barren Desert (also the only desert they know). (their region names are not that imaginative). To the far south is a place only known in rumors, the Ash Highlands.
### -- the Desert
It is difficult survive here, but certain hardy clans have managed to make do, gathering dew and lichen from rocks in the mornings, hunting desert bugs. The climate is similar to the Gobi desert in that it is dry but not hot. There are occasional grassy/bushy areas where life congregates, but these shift constantly due to sand movement and random rain. Following the volcanic activity in the Mountains its climate will shift, allowing it to transform into grassy plains that will border Ash Highlands from the northeast as well.
