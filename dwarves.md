# Species
## \- Dwarves
### -- Appearance
About 2-4 cm in length. Orange scaly skin with black spots on the back, plain grey on the underside. Look similar to geckos, see server icon. 
### -- Body function details
Sticky hands and feet. Coldblooded, so they get sluggish when temperature drops, unless heating is provided. At their size using clothes for thermal insulation is futile. Can fall from high places without much damage. Swim quite well, if the water isn't too cold.
### -- Reproduction
Dwarves are closest to hermaphrodites, though their method of reproduction is not exactly regular. Two dwarves come together and start building a cocoon around themselves out of plant fiber mixed with saliva. Once they are encased, their bodies melt and mix together in a strange metamorphosis and then grow into 2 to 4 new dwarves depending on how well fed the parents were. 
The offspring retain parts of the originals' memories but precise information might get mixed up or lost. This means most of the time younglings still require memory refreshing, and that not too many can engage in reproduction if they want to avoid losing memories
### -- Minds and Telepathy
A lone dwarf can't do much. Able to finish simple tasks and has limited memory. About 20 are needed together for basic human intelligence, though the memory won't be able to hold that much information. 50 are the gold standard for barebones self-sufficiency and good stability though they still tend to work together with other groups. More than 70 becomes unstable and has a tendency to split apart.
Telepathy is natural and instinctive. If dwarves that are otherwise unaffiliated come close together, a connection will spontaneously form between them. Once they reach somewhere between 10 and 20 members, a common awareness emerges from the connection, creating a hivemind. This hivemind will instinctively try to assimilate any living thing that comes in between its members.
### -- Clans
Clans are the basic societal unit, a sort of family. 5 to 10 tribes working together, most often closely related. Multiple clans can form even bigger structures in particularly fertile places. Most clans have roles that the individual tribes fulfill: elder/leader, forager, woodworker, beetle herder, fungi farmer...
### -- Relationships
In this age it's mostly quite simple. Singular tribes can sometimes come together and combine parts of their population either to form a new one or to revitalize their gene pool, often from different clans to keep diversity. (this is sex basically)
They can form more permanent relationships based on mutual support and/or population mixing, which are closer than the clan bond and involve 2 or 3 tribes, rarely more. They can be referred to as "joined" tribes, or just partners. It is customary that the younger tribe becomes part of the elder's clan, if the relationship is to be long term

# Tribes
The closest thing to an individual in this age. A telepathically linked group of 20-50 dwarves. They have to stay relatively close together to stay connected (1-2 meters at max). A temporary split to fulfill separate tasks is possible but keep in mind that the split off parts might be limited in intellect and that they won't be able to freely share thoughts anymore.

## \- Personality
Dwarves tend to be creatures of habit and adherence to protocol (more on protocol in the **clans** section). Longwinded discussions on the *right* way to do things are commonplace, even if there's no practical difference. (imagine the milk or cereal first schism)
